# Java Project - Collection Operations

This project consists of a series of five Java exercises that focus on various operations with collections such as Lists, Maps, Sets, and Streams. Each exercise demonstrates how to manipulate collections to perform common tasks such as sorting, filtering, reducing, and transforming data.

Below is an overview of each exercise and its objectives.

### Exercise 1: Product Management with List
In this exercise, you will manage a list of products:
- **Classes**: `Produit` and `GestionProduitApp`.
- **Features**:
    - Inserting, modifying, and removing products from a list.
    - Searching for products by name using Java streams.

### Exercise 2: Map Operations and Summary
This exercise demonstrates the use of a `Map` to store and manipulate quantities and their prices:
- **Classes**: `Main`.
- **Features**:
    - Inserting and modifying key-value pairs.
    - Calculating the sum, maximum, and minimum of values.
    - Checking for specific values within the map.

### Exercise 3: Set Operations - Intersection and Union
In this exercise, you will explore basic `Set` operations:
- **Classes**: `Main`.
- **Features**:
    - Finding the intersection of two sets.
    - Combining two sets (union operation) and displaying the results.

### Exercise 4: Stream Operations on Lists
This exercise introduces the use of streams for data manipulation on lists:
- **Classes**: `Main`.
- **Features**:
    - Filtering, mapping, and transforming list elements using streams.
    - Displaying results such as reversed names, filtered results, and more.

### Exercise 5: Employee Management and Stream Calculations
In this exercise, you will manage a list of employees and perform various operations with streams:
- **Classes**: `Employe` and `Main`.
- **Features**:
    - Calculating the sum, minimum, and maximum salary.
    - Filtering employees based on salary.
    - Sorting employees by name.
    - Concatenating employee names using streams.

## Execution Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone [GitHub repository URL]`
2. **Compile Java classes**: Navigate to each exercise directory and compile the Java files.
3. **Run the main program**: Each exercise contains a class with a `main` method to test the features.
